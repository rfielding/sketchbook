sbtree is a drawing to test metrics for ranking ratios for use in building a Just Intonation tuner for fretless music instruments.

everything else is just here by coincidence, because it's my Processing directory.

canvastest.html is a JavaScript implementation of it.  it still needs an audio input, 
but it animates to demo how the tuner makes it easy to see microtonal intervals.
